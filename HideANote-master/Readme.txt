HideANote is a java based note application that
auto hides when your mouse cursor leaves its window
area, and shows itself again when your cursor re-enters.

HideaNote stores its content on exit, so it will always remember
what you wrote. Eventually, it will allow you to synchronize
to external data sources as well (Amazon S3).
